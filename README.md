### 🗃️ Database Design

Core entity relationships:

```
🏢 Organization
  ├── 👤 Users (role-based: Admin, Moderator, User)
  ├── 📰 Feed Channels (public / private)
  │     └── 📝 Posts (with reactions, comments, pins)
  ├── 📅 Events (with RSVPs, polls, invitations)
  ├── 💼 Jobs (with applications, recommendations)
  ├── 🛒 Marketplace Items (fixed-price / auction, with bids)
  ├── 👥 User Groups (for channel access, event invitations)
  ├── 🏅 Badges (metric-based, auto-awarded)
  ├── ⚙️ Organization Settings (email, general)
  └── 📋 Audit Logs (immutable action trail)

👤 User
  ├── 🪪 Profile (skills, certifications, achievements)
  ├── 📖 Stories (24h ephemeral content)
  ├── 💬 Messages (1-to-1 conversations)
  ├── 🔔 Notifications (real-time delivery)
  ├── 📌 Bookmarks (posts, jobs, marketplace)
  ├── 🛡️ GDPR Consent (per-purpose tracking)
  └── 🤝 Connections (followers / following / blocked)
```
